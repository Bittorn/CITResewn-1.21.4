# Need Help / Found a Bug / Questions

### Porting to 1.16 or any other version:
See [#48](https://github.com/SHsuperCM/CITResewn/issues/48).

### Porting to Forge:
See [#56](https://github.com/SHsuperCM/CITResewn/issues/56).

### A resourcepack is not loading:
Check the logs, they are more useful than you think!

### Non [a-z0-9/._-] character in path of location:
The resourcepack you're using is not following minecraft's pack formatting standards.  
Contact the pack author and inform them.

For more information on Broken Paths, read the [Broken Paths section in the config docs](/usage/config).

### CIT Resewn doesn't work/crashes with another mod installed.
Check if the mod is in the incompatible section of [Supported Mods](/mods/supported/#incompatible).

### Anything else:
Feel free to open an [Issue](https://github.com/SHsuperCM/CITResewn/issues)!
